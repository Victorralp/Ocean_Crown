This is a placeholder for the night-ocean.jpg image.
In a real application, you would replace this file with an actual high-quality night ocean image.
The image should show a dark blue/black ocean at night with moonlight reflecting on the water.
For development and testing, please use any suitable night ocean or underwater night scene image.
